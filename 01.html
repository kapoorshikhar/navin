    "Revolution is necessary when natural political evolution is supressed to restore justice"
</h1>

<p>Born in the year 1883, near Nashik in Brahmin Family. He moved to london for his legal education and enrolled in Gray's Inn Law College.
Savarkar was greatly inspired by European nationalist movements, particularly those of Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy. He believed in revolution through arms and smuggled weapons into India for revolutionary activities.
</p>
<p>In 1904, Savarkar co-founded the revolutionary secret society, Abhinav Bharat Society. This organization was dedicated to the cause of Indian independence and advocated for  organized armed rebellion against British rule.
The society grew in members and  it became a hub for revolutionary activities, both in India as well as in England.
Savarkar was instrumental in setting up bomb-making workshops in India and smuggling arms into India to equip Freedom fighters. He collaborated with Indian revolutionaries based in Europe and America to ensure a steady supply of weapons for insurgents fighting the British in India. His activities in these regards were closely monitored by British Intelligence, and several members of Abhinav Bharat were arrested and tried for sedition.
</p>
<p>
Savarkar's most influential literary work, The First War of Indian Independence, written in 1909, offered a reinterpretation of the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, framing it as a national uprising rather than  just a mere rebellion. The book was banned by the British authorities but widely circulated among revolutionaries. <br>
<b>Madan Lal Dhingra Incident (1909):</b> Savarkar's associate, Madan Lal Dhingra, assassinated a British official, Sir Curzon Wyllie, in London. This incident escalated tensions between the British authorities and Indian revolutionaries. Savarkar was soon arrested in 1909 for his involvement in revolutionary activities, including smuggling  of firearms into India.
</p>
<p><b>Sentencing:</b> In 1911, Savarkar was sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment, totaling 50 years, and sent to the notorious Cellular Jail in Andaman, also known as Kalapani.<br>
<b>Brutal Conditions:</b> At Cellular Jail, Savarkar and other political prisoners endured inhumane conditions. He was subjected to months of solitary confinement, forced labor at the Kolhu (Oil Mill), and torture. He lived in a cell near the gallows, hearing the last cries of those sentenced to death.
Prisoners were denied basic facilities, given rotten food, and often left to defecate in their cells due to restricted bathroom access. This harsh treatment caused several prisoners to lose their mental health, with some committing suicide or succumbing to insanity.
Accused of abondoning the revolutionary movement post-imprisonment is a misconception as he was under constant surveillance by both British- Indian Government and post-Independance  Nehru led Indian  Government.
</p>
<p>Released under strict conditions, including ban on political activities and confinment to Ratnagiri. After the release from Ratnagiri he became the president of Hindu Mahasabha faced accusations related to assissination of Gandhi without any proofs.Later acquainted by court.</p>
<p><b>Reforms in Ratnagiri:</b> During his confinement in Ratnagiri, Savarkar continued his work, focusing on social reforms, particularly within the Hindu community.He advocated for the abolition of untouchability and the inclusion of lower castes in mainstream Hindu society. Long before B.R. Ambedkarâ€™s efforts gained prominence, Savarkar initiated campaigns against untouchability in Ratnagiri, seeking to integrate the oppressed communities into mainstream Hindu society.
In 1931, he founded the Patit Pawan Mandir in Ratnagiri, the first temple to allow entry to all Hindus regardless of caste, a groundbreaking move for the time.
